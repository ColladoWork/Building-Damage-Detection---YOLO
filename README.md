The following repository intented to show how I develop a Building Damage Detection System using YOLOv8.

📈 The goal of this project is to improve my skills in Python and Machine Learning models.

📂 The project can be divided into the following stages:

    > Building database

    > Labeling images

    > Adjusting YOLOv8 architecture

    > Analyzing graphics

    > Real-time video detection

💻 All stages were developed using Python, except for the database building and labeling processes. The labeling was performed using _([Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme))_.
