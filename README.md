The following repository intented to show how I develop a Building Damage Detection System using YOLOv8.
ðŸ“ˆ The goal of this project is to improve my skills in Python and Machine Learning models.

# The project can be divided into the following stages:
-> Building the database
-> Labeling images
-> Adjusting the YOLOv8 architecture
-> Analyzing graphics
-> Real-time video detection
ðŸ’» All stages were developed using Python, except for the database building and labeling processes. The labeling was performed using _Labelme_.
